# Permutation test
This folder contains functions to replicate the permutation tests for model prediction and predictive-feature matrices

# Folder `KRR`
* Permutation test for kernel ridge regression to determine if prediction of behavior is better than chance
* Check `CBIG_TRBPC_KRR_perm_wrapper.sh` in that folder for usage
# Folder `PFM`
* Permutation test to determine if then predictive-feature strength of a network block is significantly stronger than chance
* Check `CBIG_TRBPC_PFM_perm_wrapper.sh` in that folder for usage
