# Input
This folder contains inputs to generate figures for the project Task-Rest Behavioral Prediction in Children

## About each file
* `variables_to_predict_abcd.txt` : a text file with a list of behaviors, as named by ABCD in the ABCD 2.0.1. release, that we predicted
* `variables_to_predict.txt` : a text file with a list of behaviors in lay terms - this file is equivalent to the above file but the variable names are more easily understood by the public
* `predicted_scores.txt`: a text file with a list of behaviors that are predicted significantly better than chance.
