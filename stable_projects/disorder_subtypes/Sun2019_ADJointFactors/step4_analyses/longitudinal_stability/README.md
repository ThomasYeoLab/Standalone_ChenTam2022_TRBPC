## What Does Each File Do?
1. `CBIG_MMLDA_longitudinal_stability_wrapper.m` is the wrapper function to get factor loadings and plot a scatter plot. The x axis is the factor compositions at baseline and y axis is the factor compositions after 1 year.
2. `CBIG_MMLDA_scatter_plot_k3.m` generate the scatter plot for 3 factors.
