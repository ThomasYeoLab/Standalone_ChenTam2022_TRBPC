# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Folder `lib/` provides general functions that cover each step of our LDA procedure, including converting VBM results to "brain documents", estimating the LDA model parameters, visualizing the estimated factors, and inferring factor compositions of new participants using the learned LDA model.

Folder `replicatePNAS/` provides an example wrapper and several example input files to demonstrate how to call functions in `lib/`. In addition, these example input files were also what we used in our PNAS paper.
