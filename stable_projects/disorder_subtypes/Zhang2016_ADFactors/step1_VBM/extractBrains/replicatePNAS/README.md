# Brain Extraction with FSL BET -- Specific to Our PNAS Paper

This folder allows you to replicate the BET results in our PNAS paper (provided that all images have been downloaded from the ADNI website).

More specifically, this folder provides all the `imgList`-`BETParam` pairs so that you know what BET parameters were applied to which images.

Another purpose of this folder is to provide a simplified example of how to invoke `../lib/CBIG_runBET.sh`.

To learn the general procedure that can be easily applied to another dataset, please see folder `../lib/` instead.
