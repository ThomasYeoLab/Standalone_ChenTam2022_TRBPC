## What Does Each File Do?

1. `CBIG_wrapper.m` calls other functions in this folder.
2. `CBIG_testRetest_k3.m` is the main function that generates the plots (the `.eps` files). 
3. `CBIG_setColorByAmyloid.m` sets different colors for different amyloid status (used for Fig. S4, but not for Fig. 3).
