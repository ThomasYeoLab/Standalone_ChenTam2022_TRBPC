This folder visualizes factor compositions of the subjects for K = 2, 3 and 4.

## What Does Each File Do?

1. `CBIG_wrapper.m` shows how to call the rest two functions.
2. `CBIG_visualize_factorComp.m` visualizes factor compositions in a histogram (for K = 2), a triangle (K = 3), or a tetrahedron (K = 4).
3. `CBIG_visualize_factorComp_mixedAmyloid.m` does basically the same thing, but this time also using colors to show amyloid status.
4. The rest PDF files are our raw figures.
