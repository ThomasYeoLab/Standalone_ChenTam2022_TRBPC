This folder generates Table S1.

This folder investigates whether patient characteristics (e.g., gender) are different across the atrophy factors.

## What Does Each File Do?

1. `CBIG_wrapper.m` shows how to call the functions in this folder.
2. `CBIG_amyloidStatus.m` reports some basic statistics about amyloid, e.g., how many of the AD dementia patients are amyloid-positive.
3. `CBIG_gender.m` explores whether gender differs across the factors.
4. `CBIG_blAge_edu_amyloid_apoe_disDura_onsetAge.m` explores whether baseline age, education, amyloid, APOE, time from onset to baseline, and age at onset vary across the atrophy factors.
5. `CBIG_compute_disDura.m` computes the time from onset to baseline.
6. `CBIG_compute_weightedMeanStdDev.m` computes the weighted mean and standard deviation of a given characteristic for each factor.
7. `CBIG_doMoreMalesHaveMCI.m` is not reported in the paper.
8. `table.mat` contains the table contents of Table S1.
