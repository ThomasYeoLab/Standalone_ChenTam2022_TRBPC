## What Does Each File Do?

1. `CBIG_wrapper.m` shows how to call other functions.
2. `CBIG_compare_progression.m` is the main function comparing the factors in terms of progression from MCI to AD dementia.
3. `CBIG_compute_convLike.m` computes the likelihood of progression.
4. `CBIG_forestPlot_xRev.m` is basically the same as the one in folder `function/`, except that the x-axis is reversed.
