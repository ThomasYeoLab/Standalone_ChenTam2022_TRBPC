This folder investigates the associations between latent factors and participants' characteristics (i.e., age, sex, IQ & head motion).

Figure S3 is relevant to this folder.

## What Does Each File Do?
1. `CBIG_ASDf_fitGLM_hypoTest.m` and `CBIG_ASDf_hypoTest.m` fit a general linear model (GLM) and performs hypothesis test to compare participants' characteristic (e.g., age, IQ & head motion) across latent factors.
2. `CBIG_ASDf_logReg_compareSex.m` performs logistic regression and hypothesis test to compare participants' sex across latent factors.
3. `CBIG_ASDf_plotCmp.m` plots the pairwise comparisons.
4. `CBIG_ASDf_compareCharacteristics_wrapper.m` is the wrapper function to compare age, sex, IQ and head motion across latent factors for ASD participants in ABIDE-II+GENDAAR.
